ADVISORY : PET_DATA was chosen, but no infilling method was specified. Blank PET data will be infilled using PET_HARGREAVES_1985
ADVISORY : The required parameter RAIN_ICEPT_PCT for vegetation class VEG_ALL was autogenerated with value 0.120000
ADVISORY : The required parameter SNOW_ICEPT_PCT for vegetation class VEG_ALL was autogenerated with value 0.100000
WARNING : maximum state variable limit exceeded in initial conditions for Soil Water[0] (in HRU 1) in .rvc file
ADVISORY : Reach length in basin 1 was estimated from basin area to be 48.289843 km. (this will not be used in headwater basins)
ADVISORY : Since no processes with CANOPY_SNOW variable have been specified, all snow interception will be directly moved to the atmosphere as if it had sublimated.
ADVISORY : Since no processes with CANOPY variable have been specified, all rain interception will be directly moved to the atmosphere as if it had evaporated.
SIMULATION COMPLETE :)
